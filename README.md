georchestra.github.io
=====================

This is the source of the multilingual geOrchestra website, based on the original [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) [site template](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/tree/master/lib/site_template).



The site is built on GitHub pages, but if you want to run it locally, you first have to [install jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and its dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev nodejs
sudo gem install jekyll
```

Finally:
```
git clone https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra.github.io.git 
cd georchestra.github.io
jekyll serve --watch
```

The site can now be browsed on http://0.0.0.0:4001/ and edited live.
