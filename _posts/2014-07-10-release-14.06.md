geOrchestra 14.06 is out !
This is a maintenance version with some nice improvements.

<!--more-->

Font office:
 * a new GeoWebCache module to deploy independants tile caches; this gives more speed and availablility to high traffic layers.
 * complete german translation (thanks CIGALsace).

Hidden, but no less important :
 * more explicit roles, administration (datas / metadatas / user managemnent) and modules (extractor / statistics).
 * Single Sign On upgraded to JASIG CAS 4.0.0 final version,
 * the whole infrastructure works under https, delivers secure data services (Rennes MÃ©tropole contribution)
 * configuration is easier, build parameters are in one place, now only one database is mandatory. You still can customize anything you want for your install.
 * nice unit tests coverage on many modules (ldapadmin, mapfishapp, extractorapp, downloadform),
 * GDAL/OGR natives libraries better handling,
 * GeoFence performs better.
 
On the documentation side :
The documentation closely sticks to the source code, you can reach it directly from [README](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra/blob/14.06/README.md) in the project's root directory.

During geOcom 2014, Vienne agglomeration announced that they wrote and published a [multi-tomcat install documentation](http://geo.viennagglo.fr/doc/index.html) [[source](https://github.com/viennagglo/georchestra-doc)] under a [Open Licence](https://github.com/viennagglo/georchestra-doc/blob/master/licence.md). Thanks a lot for their commitment in the project !
