<p>The geOrchestra project is now hosted on GitHub. This migration required a
lot of work from our community. Following the internationalization of the
viewer and extractor modules, this move will facilitate contributions.</p>
<p>Sources are splitted among several repositories under the <a href="https://github.com/georchestra" hreflang="en">geOrchestra
organization</a> :</p>
<ul>
<li>the main repository <a href="https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra" hreflang="en">https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra</a> to checkout and
build the project</li>
<li>related projects; dependancies of the main project or third-party
applications</li>
</ul>
<p>Documentations, deployment protocols, continous integration tests,
bugtracking are in the pipe. The subversion repository becomes readonly; new
features will be developped on GitHub.</p>
<p>Thanks to all georchestrians for their work !</p>
