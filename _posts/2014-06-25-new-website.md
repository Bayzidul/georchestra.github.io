Checkout our brand new geOrchestra website !

<!--more-->

Based on free software ([Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)), it features a mobile-friendly blog and static pages at the same place, with full multilingual content (English, French & Spanish).

For those who are interested, or who'd like to contribute, the source code can be found in the [georchestra/georchestra.github.io](https://github.com/georchestra/georchestra.github.io) repository.

Jekyll offers powerful support for code snippets, here in ruby:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

To finish with, we'd like to thank GitHub for their awesome hosting.
