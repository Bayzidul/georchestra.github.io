Checkout our brand new geOrchestra website !

Based on free software ([Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)), it features a blog and static pages at the same place, with full multilingual content (english, french & spanish).
We'd like to thank GitHub for their awesome hosting.

Jekyll offers powerful support for code snippets, here in ruby:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
