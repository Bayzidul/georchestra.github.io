## Story

The geOrchestra project started 2009 when the Britanny spatial data infrastructure was under construction. Users and developpers decided to place the source code under FOSS. An independant project steering committee was appointed to drive the project, address the emerging community, vote changes.

Subsequently, many people studied, adapted, translated geOrchestra modules for their own needs.

Initially hosted on a brittany software repository, the source code moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/georchestra) in 2012. This improved greatly the code accessibility and obviously made contributions easier. The commit rates grow up dramatically.

## Meetings

Every year, users and developpers of the community meet in a different place to share experiences, sum up good practices and elaborate the roadmap. Previous events took place :

 * at [Agrocampus Ouest](http://www.agrocampus-ouest.fr/), Rennes, France, for 2013,
 * at Centre Régional Auvergnat de l'Information Géographique ([CRAIG](http://craig.fr/)), Clermont-Ferrand, France for 2014


## Steering committee

The steering committee features 8 members :

 * Lydie Vinsonneau, SDI operator
 * Fabrice Phung, SDI operator
 * François Van Der Biest, developper, release manager
 * Pierre Mauduit, developper, sysadmin
 * Sylvain Lesage, SDI operator, developper
