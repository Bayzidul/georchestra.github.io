## Story

The geOrchestra project started back in 2009 when the Brittany spatial data infrastructure was under construction. Users and developers decided to place the source code under an open licence. An independant project steering committee was appointed to drive the project, address the emerging community, and vote changes.

Subsequently, many people studied, adapted, and translated geOrchestra modules for their own needs.

Initially hosted on a Brittany-hosted software repository, the source code finally moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/georchestra) in 2012. This greatly improved code accessibility and obviously made contributions easier. The commit rates grew up dramatically.

## Meetings

Every year, users and developers from the community meet in a different place to share experiences, sum up good practices and elaborate the roadmap. 

This year, [meet us](/blog/2015/02/06/geocom2015-announced/) on June 22-24th in Strasbourg, France.

Previous events took place:

 * at [Agrocampus Ouest](http://www.agrocampus-ouest.fr/), Rennes, France, for 2013,
 * at Centre Régional Auvergnat de l'Information Géographique ([CRAIG](http://craig.fr/)), Clermont-Ferrand, France for 2014
